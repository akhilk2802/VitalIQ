# Factors Affecting Sleep Quality

## Environmental Factors

### Temperature
- Optimal bedroom temperature: 60-67°F (15-19°C)
- Body temperature naturally drops during sleep
- Too warm environments disrupt sleep architecture
- Cool temperatures promote deep sleep

### Light Exposure
- Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin
- Darkness signals the brain to produce melatonin
- Even dim light can disrupt circadian rhythm
- Morning light exposure helps regulate sleep-wake cycle

### Noise
- Consistent, low-level background noise may help some sleepers
- Sudden noises cause micro-awakenings
- White noise can mask disruptive sounds

### Bedding and Mattress
- Supportive mattress reduces sleep disturbances
- Replace mattress every 7-10 years
- Appropriate pillows support neutral spine alignment

## Lifestyle Factors

### Caffeine
- Half-life of 5-6 hours
- Avoid caffeine 6+ hours before bedtime
- Can reduce deep sleep even when consumed early
- Individual sensitivity varies significantly

### Alcohol
- May help fall asleep faster initially
- Disrupts sleep architecture in second half of night
- Reduces REM sleep
- Increases nighttime awakenings
- Can worsen sleep apnea

### Exercise
- Regular exercise improves sleep quality
- Timing matters: vigorous exercise 1-2 hours before bed may disrupt sleep
- Morning or afternoon exercise is optimal
- Even light exercise like walking helps

### Meal Timing
- Large meals close to bedtime can disrupt sleep
- Finish eating 2-3 hours before bed
- High-fat meals may reduce sleep quality
- Some foods contain sleep-promoting compounds (e.g., cherries, kiwi)

## Physiological Factors

### Stress and Anxiety
- Activates sympathetic nervous system
- Elevates cortisol, suppresses melatonin
- Racing thoughts prevent sleep onset
- Can cause frequent awakenings

### Age
- Sleep architecture changes with age
- Older adults have less deep sleep
- Increased sleep fragmentation
- Earlier sleep timing (advanced sleep phase)

### Medical Conditions
- Sleep apnea disrupts sleep architecture
- Chronic pain reduces sleep quality
- Restless legs syndrome causes difficulty falling asleep
- Depression and anxiety affect sleep patterns

### Medications
- Many medications affect sleep
- Beta blockers may reduce melatonin
- Some antidepressants suppress REM sleep
- Stimulant medications disrupt sleep

## Sleep Hygiene Best Practices

1. Maintain consistent sleep/wake times
2. Create a relaxing bedtime routine
3. Reserve bed for sleep and intimacy only
4. Limit screen time before bed
5. Get regular sunlight exposure, especially morning
6. Exercise regularly but not too close to bedtime
7. Limit caffeine and alcohol
8. Keep bedroom cool, dark, and quiet
9. Manage stress through relaxation techniques
10. If unable to sleep after 20 minutes, get up and do a calm activity
