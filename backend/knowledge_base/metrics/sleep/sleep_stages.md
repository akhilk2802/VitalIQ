# Sleep Stages and Architecture

## Overview of Sleep Stages

Sleep is divided into two main types: Non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. A complete sleep cycle typically lasts 90-120 minutes and repeats 4-6 times per night.

## Non-REM Sleep

### Stage 1 (N1) - Light Sleep
- Duration: 1-7 minutes
- Characteristics: Transition from wakefulness to sleep
- Brain waves: Alpha waves transition to theta waves
- Easy to wake from this stage
- May experience hypnic jerks (sudden muscle contractions)

### Stage 2 (N2) - Light Sleep
- Duration: 10-25 minutes initially, longer in later cycles
- Comprises about 50% of total sleep time
- Brain waves: Sleep spindles and K-complexes
- Body temperature drops, heart rate slows
- Important for memory consolidation

### Stage 3 (N3) - Deep Sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep)
- Duration: 20-40 minutes in early cycles
- Most restorative stage for physical recovery
- Brain waves: Delta waves (slow waves)
- Growth hormone is released
- Immune system strengthening occurs
- Most difficult to wake from
- Decreases with age

## REM Sleep

- First REM period: About 90 minutes after falling asleep
- Duration: Starts at ~10 minutes, increases to 30-60 minutes in later cycles
- Characteristics:
  - Rapid eye movements
  - Temporary muscle paralysis (atonia)
  - Vivid dreaming
  - Brain activity similar to waking
- Functions:
  - Memory consolidation
  - Emotional processing
  - Learning enhancement
  - Brain restoration

## Sleep Architecture Changes

### By Age
- Infants: 50% REM sleep
- Adults: 20-25% REM sleep
- Elderly: Reduced deep sleep, more fragmented sleep

### During the Night
- Early cycles: More deep sleep (N3)
- Later cycles: More REM sleep
- Light sleep (N1, N2) consistent throughout

## Implications for Health Tracking

When assessing sleep quality, consider:
- Total sleep duration (7-9 hours recommended for adults)
- Time to fall asleep (should be 10-20 minutes)
- Wake after sleep onset (WASO)
- Sleep efficiency (time asleep / time in bed)
- Distribution of sleep stages
