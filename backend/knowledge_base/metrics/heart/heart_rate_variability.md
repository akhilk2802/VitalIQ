# Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

## What is HRV?

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. Despite the name suggesting heart rate, HRV is actually a measure of the variation in the intervals between beats (R-R intervals), not the rate itself.

## Why HRV Matters

HRV is considered one of the best non-invasive markers of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function:
- Higher HRV generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness
- Lower HRV is associated with stress, fatigue, and various health conditions
- HRV reflects the balance between sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) nervous systems

## Normal HRV Ranges

HRV varies significantly by individual, age, and measurement method:

### RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)
- Common metric measured by wearables
- Typical healthy adult range: 20-100+ ms
- Athletes often have higher values
- Decreases with age

### By Age (General RMSSD Guidelines)
- 20-25 years: 45-90 ms
- 25-35 years: 40-75 ms
- 35-45 years: 35-65 ms
- 45-55 years: 25-55 ms
- 55+ years: 20-45 ms

## Factors That Increase HRV

### Positive Influences
- Regular aerobic exercise
- Good sleep quality and adequate duration
- Relaxation and meditation
- Proper hydration
- Balanced nutrition
- Recovery from exercise
- Positive emotional states

### Lifestyle Factors
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Deep breathing exercises
- Cold exposure (in moderation)
- Time in nature
- Social connection

## Factors That Decrease HRV

### Acute Factors
- Stress and anxiety
- Poor sleep
- Illness and infection
- Intense exercise (temporarily)
- Alcohol consumption
- Dehydration

### Chronic Factors
- Chronic stress
- Overtraining
- Sleep disorders
- Poor diet
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Aging

### Medical Conditions
- Cardiovascular disease
- Diabetes
- Depression and anxiety disorders
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Autonomic dysfunction

## HRV and Recovery

HRV is widely used to assess recovery status:
- Morning HRV measurement provides baseline
- Consistently low HRV may indicate accumulated stress
- Sudden drops may indicate illness, overtraining, or stress
- Recovery days show gradual HRV improvement

## Using HRV Data

### Daily Tracking
- Measure at the same time daily (morning recommended)
- Track trends over time, not single readings
- Consider 7-day rolling average
- Account for lifestyle factors when interpreting

### Training Applications
- Low HRV days: Consider lighter training
- High HRV days: Body may handle more intensity
- Combine with subjective feelings for best results

### Health Monitoring
- Sudden persistent changes warrant attention
- Compare to personal baseline, not population averages
- Consider context (stress, sleep, illness)
