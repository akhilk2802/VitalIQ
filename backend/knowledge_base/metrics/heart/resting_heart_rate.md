# Resting Heart Rate

## What is Resting Heart Rate?

Resting heart rate (RHR) is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you're at complete rest. It's a simple but powerful indicator of overall cardiovascular health and fitness.

## Normal Ranges

### General Adult Guidelines
- Normal range: 60-100 beats per minute (bpm)
- Well-trained athletes: 40-60 bpm
- Some elite athletes: Below 40 bpm

### By Age (Average Healthy Adults)
- 18-25 years: 65-75 bpm
- 26-35 years: 65-75 bpm
- 36-45 years: 66-76 bpm
- 46-55 years: 67-77 bpm
- 56-65 years: 68-78 bpm
- 65+ years: 67-77 bpm

### By Fitness Level
- Poor: >83 bpm (males), >84 bpm (females)
- Below average: 75-83 bpm (males), 77-84 bpm (females)
- Average: 69-74 bpm (males), 72-76 bpm (females)
- Above average: 63-68 bpm (males), 66-71 bpm (females)
- Good: 58-62 bpm (males), 61-65 bpm (females)
- Excellent: 52-57 bpm (males), 56-60 bpm (females)
- Athlete: ≤51 bpm (males), ≤55 bpm (females)

## Factors That Lower Resting Heart Rate

### Positive Influences
- Regular cardiovascular exercise
- Good cardiovascular fitness
- Adequate sleep
- Relaxation and stress management
- Healthy weight

### Physiological Factors
- Strong, efficient heart muscle
- Good autonomic nervous system function
- Genetics (family history of low RHR)

## Factors That Elevate Resting Heart Rate

### Lifestyle Factors
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor sleep
- Chronic stress
- Dehydration
- Caffeine
- Nicotine and tobacco

### Health Conditions
- Anemia
- Thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism)
- Fever and infection
- Heart conditions
- Obesity
- Anxiety disorders

### Temporary Elevations
- Recent exercise
- Caffeine consumption
- Emotional stress
- Hot environment
- Certain medications

## When to Be Concerned

### Consistently High RHR (>100 bpm)
- Called tachycardia
- May indicate underlying health issue
- Should be evaluated by healthcare provider

### Consistently Low RHR (<60 bpm)
- Called bradycardia
- May be normal in athletes
- If accompanied by symptoms, seek evaluation
- Symptoms: dizziness, fatigue, fainting

### Sudden Changes
- Sudden persistent increase may indicate:
  - Illness or infection
  - Stress or anxiety
  - Dehydration
  - Medication effects
- Seek medical attention if accompanied by:
  - Chest pain
  - Shortness of breath
  - Fainting
  - Severe dizziness

## Measuring Resting Heart Rate

### Best Practices
1. Measure first thing in the morning before getting up
2. After waking, lie still for 1-2 minutes
3. Use consistent method (pulse check or device)
4. Track over time for meaningful trends
5. Avoid measurement after caffeine, alcohol, or stress

### What Wearables Measure
- Many devices track RHR during sleep
- "Lowest heart rate" may be more accurate
- Morning average provides good baseline
- Week-over-week trends more valuable than single readings

## RHR and Fitness

### Training Effect
- Aerobic training strengthens heart muscle
- Stronger heart pumps more blood per beat
- Results in lower RHR over time
- Takes weeks to months to see changes

### Recovery Indicator
- Elevated RHR may indicate incomplete recovery
- Can signal overtraining
- Useful alongside HRV for training decisions
