# Blood Glucose Monitoring

## What is Blood Glucose?

Blood glucose (blood sugar) is the main type of sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat and is your body's primary source of energy. Maintaining stable blood glucose levels is important for overall health and energy.

## Normal Ranges

### Fasting Blood Glucose
- Normal: Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
- Prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L)
- Diabetes: 126 mg/dL or higher (7.0 mmol/L)

### Post-Meal Blood Glucose (2 hours after eating)
- Normal: Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
- Prediabetes: 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L)
- Diabetes: 200 mg/dL or higher (11.1 mmol/L)

### HbA1c (Average over 2-3 months)
- Normal: Below 5.7%
- Prediabetes: 5.7-6.4%
- Diabetes: 6.5% or higher

## Factors Affecting Blood Glucose

### Increases Blood Glucose
- Carbohydrate-rich foods (especially refined)
- Large portion sizes
- Stress (cortisol release)
- Illness and infection
- Lack of physical activity
- Certain medications
- Poor sleep
- Caffeine (in some individuals)

### Decreases Blood Glucose
- Physical activity
- Insulin and diabetes medications
- Fasting or skipping meals
- Alcohol (can cause delayed drops)
- Very low carbohydrate diets

## Glycemic Response

### Glycemic Index (GI)
- Low GI (55 or less): Slow glucose rise
  - Examples: most vegetables, legumes, whole grains
- Medium GI (56-69): Moderate rise
  - Examples: some fruits, brown rice
- High GI (70+): Rapid glucose rise
  - Examples: white bread, sugary drinks, potatoes

### Glycemic Load (GL)
- Considers both GI and portion size
- More practical for real-world eating
- Low GL: 10 or less
- Medium GL: 11-19
- High GL: 20 or more

### Factors Affecting Glycemic Response
- Fiber content (slows absorption)
- Fat content (slows digestion)
- Protein content (modest impact)
- Food preparation method
- Individual variation (significant)

## Blood Glucose and Health Metrics

### Sleep Connection
- Poor sleep decreases insulin sensitivity
- Blood glucose spikes can disrupt sleep
- Late-night eating affects overnight glucose

### Exercise Connection
- Immediate effect: glucose used for energy
- Post-exercise: improved insulin sensitivity
- Regular exercise: long-term glucose control
- Intense exercise may temporarily raise glucose

### Stress Connection
- Cortisol increases glucose production
- Chronic stress impairs insulin sensitivity
- Stress management helps glucose control

## Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)

### What CGMs Show
- Real-time glucose levels
- Trends and patterns
- Response to different foods
- Effect of exercise on glucose
- Overnight patterns

### Useful Metrics
- Time in range (70-180 mg/dL)
- Glucose variability
- Average glucose
- Number of highs and lows

## Lifestyle Strategies for Glucose Control

### Nutrition
- Prioritize fiber-rich foods
- Include protein with meals
- Healthy fats slow absorption
- Watch portion sizes of carbs
- Limit added sugars
- Consider meal timing

### Physical Activity
- Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity
- Walking after meals reduces spikes
- Combination of aerobic and resistance training optimal

### Sleep
- Aim for 7-9 hours
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Avoid late-night eating

### Stress Management
- Chronic stress affects glucose
- Relaxation techniques help
- Mind-body practices beneficial
