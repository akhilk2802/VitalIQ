# Macronutrients Guide

## Overview

Macronutrients are nutrients the body needs in large amounts for energy and proper function. The three primary macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

## Carbohydrates

### Function
- Primary energy source for the body
- Essential fuel for brain and nervous system
- Important for physical activity
- Stored as glycogen in muscles and liver

### Types
**Simple Carbohydrates**
- Quick energy, rapid blood sugar rise
- Found in: sugar, honey, fruit, milk
- Best consumed with other macros to slow absorption

**Complex Carbohydrates**
- Slower digestion, sustained energy
- Found in: whole grains, vegetables, legumes
- Provide fiber and nutrients

### Recommended Intake
- General: 45-65% of total calories
- Athletes: May need more (6-10g/kg body weight for endurance)
- Low-carb diets: Typically <100g/day

### Impact on Health Tracking
- Affects blood glucose levels
- Influences energy and mood
- Timing affects sleep (large carb meals close to bed)

## Protein

### Function
- Building and repair of tissues
- Enzyme and hormone production
- Immune function
- Satiety and appetite regulation

### Sources
**Complete Proteins (all essential amino acids)**
- Animal sources: meat, fish, eggs, dairy
- Plant sources: soy, quinoa

**Incomplete Proteins**
- Legumes, nuts, seeds, grains
- Combine to get all amino acids

### Recommended Intake
- Sedentary adults: 0.8g per kg body weight
- Active individuals: 1.2-1.6g per kg
- Athletes/strength training: 1.6-2.2g per kg
- Older adults: 1.0-1.2g per kg (to prevent muscle loss)

### Timing
- Distribute throughout day for optimal muscle protein synthesis
- Post-exercise protein supports recovery
- Protein at breakfast may improve satiety

## Fats

### Function
- Energy storage
- Hormone production
- Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Cell membrane structure
- Brain health

### Types
**Unsaturated Fats (healthy)**
- Monounsaturated: olive oil, avocados, nuts
- Polyunsaturated: fatty fish, flaxseed, walnuts
- Omega-3s: anti-inflammatory benefits

**Saturated Fats**
- Animal products, coconut oil
- Moderate intake recommended
- Associated with increased LDL cholesterol when excessive

**Trans Fats (avoid)**
- Artificially hydrogenated oils
- Linked to heart disease
- Check labels for "partially hydrogenated"

### Recommended Intake
- 20-35% of total calories
- Emphasize unsaturated fats
- Limit saturated to <10% of calories
- Avoid trans fats

## Macronutrient Balance

### General Recommendations
- Carbohydrates: 45-65%
- Protein: 10-35%
- Fat: 20-35%

### Considerations for Health Goals
**Weight Loss**
- Higher protein (1.2-1.6g/kg) helps preserve muscle
- Moderate carbs, focus on fiber
- Don't eliminate fats entirely

**Muscle Building**
- Higher protein (1.6-2.2g/kg)
- Adequate carbs for training energy
- Sufficient fat for hormones

**Endurance Performance**
- Higher carbs for glycogen
- Moderate protein for recovery
- Essential fats for inflammation management

## Tracking Considerations

### What to Monitor
- Total calories for energy balance
- Protein intake for muscle maintenance
- Carbohydrate timing around activity
- Fat quality (emphasize healthy fats)

### Common Issues
- Insufficient protein (common in general population)
- Excessive added sugars
- Imbalanced fat intake (too many saturated fats)
- Inadequate fiber from carbohydrate sources
