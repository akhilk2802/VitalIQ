# Sleep Improvement Interventions

## Evidence-Based Strategies

This guide covers interventions with scientific support for improving sleep quality and duration.

## Sleep Hygiene Fundamentals

### Consistent Schedule
- **What**: Same bedtime and wake time daily
- **Why**: Reinforces circadian rhythm
- **Evidence**: Strong support for circadian alignment
- **Tip**: Maintain schedule even on weekends (within 1 hour)

### Sleep Environment Optimization
**Temperature**
- Optimal: 60-67°F (15-19°C)
- Cool environment promotes sleep onset
- Body temperature drop signals sleep

**Darkness**
- Complete darkness is ideal
- Use blackout curtains or eye mask
- Cover LED lights
- Blue light blocking glasses if needed

**Quiet**
- Minimize noise disruptions
- White noise can mask sudden sounds
- Earplugs if needed

**Comfort**
- Quality mattress and pillows
- Breathable bedding
- Clutter-free bedroom

### Pre-Sleep Routine
- 30-60 minute wind-down period
- Consistent activities signal sleep time
- Relaxing activities only
- Dim lights in the evening

## Behavioral Interventions

### Stimulus Control
1. Use bed only for sleep (and intimacy)
2. Go to bed only when sleepy
3. If awake >20 minutes, get up and do calm activity
4. Return to bed when sleepy
5. Wake at same time regardless of sleep duration

### Sleep Restriction (for insomnia)
- Temporarily limit time in bed
- Increases sleep drive
- Improves sleep efficiency
- Should be done under guidance
- Gradually increase time as efficiency improves

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
- Gold standard for chronic insomnia
- Addresses thoughts and behaviors
- More effective than medication long-term
- Components: sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring
- Available in-person or via apps

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Exercise
- Regular exercise improves sleep
- Timing: Finish 1-2 hours before bed (for intense exercise)
- Amount: 150+ minutes moderate activity per week
- Type: Both aerobic and resistance beneficial

### Nutrition
**Helpful**
- Avoid large meals close to bedtime
- Tryptophan-rich foods (turkey, nuts, seeds)
- Magnesium-rich foods (leafy greens, nuts)
- Tart cherries (natural melatonin)
- Kiwi (shown to improve sleep onset)

**Avoid Before Bed**
- Heavy, fatty meals
- Spicy foods
- Large fluid intake
- High sugar foods

### Caffeine Management
- Half-life: 5-6 hours
- Stop caffeine 6-8 hours before bed
- Be aware of hidden caffeine (chocolate, medications)
- Individual sensitivity varies greatly

### Alcohol
- Avoid within 3 hours of bedtime
- Disrupts sleep architecture
- Reduces REM sleep
- Causes more awakenings in second half of night

## Light Exposure

### Morning Light
- Get bright light within 30 minutes of waking
- 10-30 minutes of outdoor light ideal
- Helps set circadian rhythm
- Light therapy lamps for dark months

### Evening Light
- Dim lights 1-2 hours before bed
- Blue light blocking glasses if using screens
- Night mode on devices
- Avoid bright overhead lights

## Relaxation Techniques

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation
- Systematically tense and release muscle groups
- Reduces physical tension
- 10-15 minutes before bed
- Many guided options available

### Deep Breathing
- 4-7-8 breathing technique
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Activates parasympathetic system
- Can be done in bed

### Mindfulness and Meditation
- Reduces racing thoughts
- Body scan meditation
- Sleep-focused guided meditations
- Apps available (Calm, Headspace, etc.)

## Supplements (Discuss with Healthcare Provider)

### Melatonin
- Helps with timing, not necessarily duration
- Most useful for jet lag, shift work
- Low doses (0.5-3mg) often sufficient
- Take 30-60 minutes before bed
- Not for long-term use without guidance

### Magnesium
- May help if deficient
- Forms: glycinate, citrate often preferred
- Generally safe at appropriate doses
- May improve sleep quality

### Other Considerations
- Valerian root: mixed evidence
- L-theanine: may reduce anxiety
- Glycine: some evidence for sleep quality
- Always consult healthcare provider

## When to Seek Help

### Red Flags
- Persistent insomnia (>3 months)
- Symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, gasping)
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Sleep issues affecting daily function
- Suspected restless legs syndrome

### Professional Options
- Sleep physician consultation
- Sleep study (polysomnography)
- CBT-I with trained therapist
- Evaluation for underlying conditions
